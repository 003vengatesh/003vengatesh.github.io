            <h2>Unleashing the Power of Data</h2>
            <p>In this fast-paced world where data reigns supreme, I've taken it upon myself to become its staunchest ally. Proficient in Python, SQL, and an arsenal of data science tools, I'm not just crunching numbers; I'm deciphering stories, unlocking insights, and crafting solutions that resonate with brilliance.</p>
    
            <h2>A Journey Fueled by Curiosity</h2>
            <p>My journey into the world of technology is marked not just by milestones but by moments of awe and wonder. From the intricacies of machine learning algorithms to the elegance of data visualization, each discovery fuels my passion and propels me towards greater horizons.</p>
    
            <h2>Beyond the Classroom Walls</h2>
            <p> But my story isn't confined to the walls of academia. I've ventured into the realm of internships, where theory meets practice, and ideas take flight. From optimizing inventory management to crafting predictive models, I've honed my skills and left an indelible mark on every project I've undertaken.</p>
    
            <h2>Skills that Define the Future</h2>
            <p>
            <strong>Programming:</strong> Python, Java, R, HTML, CSS<br>
            <strong>Data:</strong> Analytics, Visualization<br>
